    detailedDescription:
      "sKINs is a film and textile-based documentary project that traces the movement of visual elements such as motifs, symbols, rituals, and garments across mediums, cultures, and generations. It explores how visual language is exchanged, transformed, and reinterpreted through time. Rooted in the idea that our lives are extensions of our skin: surfaces where culture, memory, and place imprint themselves. The title plays on ‘KIN’, pointing to kinship and shared humanity, while the “s” speaks to skin as both protection and adornment",

Her image serves as a quiet yet powerful thread connecting past and present. sKINs N.E. celebrates ancestral body adornment as a form of wearable art, transforming symbols once etched into skin into garments that carry memory, meaning, and resilience.

Through its dynamic patterns and colorways, it conveys a story from far away /originally from Indonesia/ and has made its way into East African traditions. It is vital in hot climates and preferred during khat chewing rituals/as shown in sKINs: Dire Dawa opening scene/ where it provides a breathable silhouette. For warriors in Ethiopia, it serves as protection from harsh sun and wind; a practical solution when carrying minimal items. During battle its role deepens even more; fallen soldiers are wrapped in their own Sheret when burials aren’t possible.",

Against the backdrop of 1970s Addis Ababa, the exhibition explores how architecture and the everyday objects we live with shape our emotions, identities, and collective memory. Through eight immersive sets, the work moves between elemental abstractions:- fire, air, water, earth and reconstructions of lived Ethiopian spaces, from the monochrome photo studios to the compact bachelor rooms of the 1970s. A dining room at the center binds these worlds together, its suspended sack of household items exposing what is often hidden: the quiet significance of what we keep and carry. Bet/Bota is both house and history, exhibition and archive- an invitation to reflect on how space holds us, and how we in turn hold space.",

      "“Ete’ya,” a tribute to the revered Queen of Ethiopia, draws inspiration from her iconic blue cloak. This project modernizes traditional Ethiopian garments, featuring a hand-dyed cotton cloak with extended sleeves in homage to the queen. Complementing the cloak, the red wrap pant prioritizes comfort and flexibility for the dancer, tied at the wrists and embroidered with wing imagery symbolizing Ete’ya’s angelic disappearance. Inspired by the tradition in Gojam, where women shave their heads and wear black headscarves in tribute to Ete’ya, this project incorporates a red headscarf, symbolizing love and devotion to the queen. Set in the lively Merkato market in Addis Ababa, the dancer moves through the bustling crowd, embodying the struggle to preserve identity amid change. The choreography captures the beauty of fearlessness, creating a powerful tribute to Queen Ete’ya’s legacy.",
